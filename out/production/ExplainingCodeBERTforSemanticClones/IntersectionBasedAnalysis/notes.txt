We want to answer the following:

How many times is a wheat statement also a human core?
How many times is a culprit statement core, or non-core or unsure?
How many times is a positive shap statement also a human core?
How many times is a negative shap statement also non-core?

To do this, we will create csv files for both m1 and m2 permutes for the following formats

clonefilename,m1/m2,smtnum,wheatstatusbit(0 or 1)=====(m1 done, m2 done)
clonefilename,m1,m2,smtnum,shapvalue (already available) ShapRankingm1permuteSecond.csv and ShapRankingm2permute.csv
clonefilename,m1/m2,smtnum,culpritstatus(0 or 1)====(done for m1 and m2)
shamsa/xue,clonefilename,m1/m2,smtnum,human intuition(0 or 1 or -1)

Then, we can simply do analysis in excel
